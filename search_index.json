other functions in @parity/light.js, or else the library will throw an error!\nHere are some examples of providers you can use.\nProvider 1: Your own Light Client (Recommended Way for development)\nMake sure a Light Client is running locally with a WebSocket server on port 8546. Follow this tutorial to learn how to do it.\nThen create a new provider that connects to the Light Client:\nimport Api from '@parity/api';\nimport light from '@parity/light.js';\n\n// The dapp and the Light Client communicate via WebSocket. Other\n// possibilities are Http or IPC.\nconst provider = new Api.Provider.Ws('ws://127.0.0.1:8546');\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\n// Your app...\n\nNote: @parity/api is Parity's version of web3.js, but you can also web3.js instead. Please refer to @parity/api documentation to see the difference.\nNote: As of August 2018, this method is only suitable for local development only. If you put your dapp online, there is no easy way it'll have its own \"local\" Light Client. We recommend using another provider in this case.\nHowever, if you are building a mobile application or an Electron desktop application, then the Light Client can be easily embedded into the application itself. For an example, see Fether.\nProvider 2: MetaMask\nMake sure you have MetaMask installed. Then,\nimport light from '@parity/light.js';\n\nwindow.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  // Wait for web3.currentProvider to be injected\n  light.setProvider(window.web3.currentProvider);\n\n  startApp();\n});\n\nProvider 3: INFURA\nimport Api from '@parity/api';\nimport light from '@parity/light.js';\n\n// The dapp and the INFURA node communicate via WebSockets.\nconst provider = new Api.Provider.Ws('wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws');\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\n// Your app...\n\nProvider 4: Your own Full Node\nMake sure you have a full node running.\nimport Api from '@parity/api';\nimport light from '@parity/light.js';\n\n// The dapp and the full node communicate via WebSocket. Other\n// possibilities are Http or IPC.\nconst provider = new Api.Provider.Ws('ws://127.0.0.1:8546');\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\n// Your app...\n\n"},"getting-started/does-it-work-with-a-full-node.html":{"url":"getting-started/does-it-work-with-a-full-node.html","title":"Does this work with a full node?","keywords":"","body":"Does this work with a full node?\nYes.

Read the chapter on Light Client Development to learn more.\n@parity/light.js is merely a library which regroups all these best development patterns in a simple API.\n"},"guides/tutorial1-set-up-a-light-client.html":{"url":"guides/tutorial1-set-up-a-light-client.html","title":"Tutorial Part 1: Set up a Light Client","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial Part 1: Set up a Light Client for Development\nAt Parity Technologies, we believe that Light Clients will play a big role in the Ethereum network in the future. However, today, Light Clients are still mainly experimental.\nFor development, there's no big risk in using a Light Client. If anything, it's a small step towards making the network more decentralized.\nDownload the Light Client\nPlease install Parity Ethereum first: https://parity.io. Then run Parity Ethereum with the following flags:\n/path/to/parity --chain kovan --light --ws-origins all\n\nWe are using the Kovan testnet so that we are not testing our dapp with real Ether. To get some fake Kovan ETH to play with, head to the faucet: https://faucet.kovan.network/.\nThe Light Client should take a couple of minutes to sync. Head to our wiki to learn more about the Light Client.\n"},"guides/tutorial2-our-first-rpcobservable.html":{"url":"guides/tutorial2-our-first-rpcobservable.html","title":"Tutorial Part 2: Our First RpcObservable","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial Part 2: Our First RpcObservable\nOnce the Light Client is sync, we can start to write a dapp to connect to it. Our dapp will be written in React, and use create-react-app for tooling. Of course, if you're writing your dapp in Angular, Vue or vanilla JavaScript, the tutorial should be simple enough for you to be able to easily port to your tech stack.\nFollow create-react-app's tutorial to install it. Then,\ncreate-react-app my-dapp\ncd my-dapp\nyarn start # using npm will work too\n\nYour dapp should be running on localhost:3000! For now it's rather underwhelming as it's just create-react-app's default homepage.\nAdd @parity/light.js\nNow we have our basic dapp harness, we can start introducing more interesting functionality. Without too much ado, let's get started. In the project root folder, run:\nyarn add @parity/api @parity/light.js\n\n@parity/api is Parity's equivalent of web3.js, click here to see @parity/api documentation. We're only using it in our dapp to create a Provider to connect to our Light Client: let's create a file src/provider.js to define this provider:\nimport Api from '@parity/api';\n\nconst provider = window.web3\n  ? window.web3.currentProvider\n  : new Api.Provider.Ws('ws://127.0.0.1:8546');\n\nexport default provider;\n\nHere, we're saying that if there is a web3 provider present (for example injected by MetaMask), then we use it. Or else, by default, we connect to our local Light Client which we spawned in the previous step.\nNow, we can go to src/index.js, which is the entry point of our dapp, and connect to the provider.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport light from '@parity/light.js';\n\nimport App from './App';\nimport provider from './provider';\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nOur first RpcObservable\nThe whole @parity/light.js works with the concept of RpcObservables, the link shows detailed information about those.\nFor now, let's just see how to use them. Make the following change in src/index.js:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n-import light from '@parity/light.js';\n+import light, { blockNumber$ } from '@parity/light.js';\n\nimport App from './App';\nimport provider from './provider';\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\n+blockNumber$().subscribe(blockNumber =>\n+  console.log('blockNumber', blockNumber)\n+);\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nIf you have never heard of Observables, think of them as Promises that can resolve multiple times. Here, each time the Observable 'fires', we are logging the result. If you wish to quickly learn about Observables, read the section on Reactive Programming.\nA RpcObservable is a function that returns an Observable (calling a JSONRPC request behind the scenes). Here, blockNumber$() returns an Observable that will fire each time our Light Client receives a new block.\nHere's another RpcObservable, returning the balance of an account, and logging it each time this balance changes.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n-import light, { blockNumber$ } from '@parity/light.js';\n+import light, { balanceOf$, blockNumber$ } from '@parity/light.js';\n\nimport App from './App';\nimport provider from './provider';\n\nlight.setProvider(provider);\n\nblockNumber$().subscribe(blockNumber =>\n  console.log('blockNumber', blockNumber)\n);\n+balanceOf$('0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1').subscribe(balance =>\n+  console.log('balance', balance)\n+);\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nA live demo of this code can be seen here: https://codesandbox.io/s/wk7y9n77wl. Open the browser console on this page to see the logged block numbers and balances, as BigNumber objects.\n"},"guides/tutorial3-manipulating-rpcobservables.html":{"url":"guides/tutorial3-manipulating-rpcobservables.html","title":"Tutorial Part 3: Manipulating RpcObservables","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial Part 3: Manipulating RpcObservables\nLoading state of a RpcObservable\nIn the previous live demo, you may have noticed that when fetching balance, the console logs Symbol(Fetching RPC...), whereas blockNumber$ doesn't.\nThis is because balanceOf$ is a RpcObservable that needs to make a network call. The Light Client constantly listens to new headers from its peers, so it holds the \"latest block number\" information in its database, and can directly transfer this information to the dapp. However, if the Light Client wants to know the balance of an account (or anything that lives in the state), then it needs to make a network requests to ask its peers for this piece of information.\nThis is what happens with balanceOf$. On every new block, balanceOf$ makes a JSONRPC request (eth_getBalance), and the Light Client relays this request to the network. This call has some latency, and the latency is shown with Symbol(Fetching RPC...).\nConcretely, in your app, a possible UX would be to show a loading spinner while we receive Symbol(Fetching RPC...) from the RpcObservable.\nRemoving the loading state\nHowever, if this behavior is not desirable for you, the you can add the withoutLoading operator:\nimport { withoutLoading } from '@parity/light.js';\n\nbalanceOf$('0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1')\n  .pipe(withoutLoading())\n  .subscribe(balance => console.log('balance', balance));\n\nIn this case, the Symbol(Fetching RPC...) will never be logged, and you will only be notified when the balance actually changes.\nSee here for a working example: https://codesandbox.io/s/z6549wqm5l.\nwithoutLoading() here is what we call a RxJS operator. It modifies the result each time an Observable fires. Let's see some other operators.\nOperators on Observables\nSince @parity/light.js relies heavily on RxJS Observables, all the tools for playing with Observables are available for you to use.\nFormat the balance nicely\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport { withoutLoading } from '@parity/light.js';\n\nbalanceOf$('0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1')\n  .pipe(\n    withoutLoading(), // We can chain operators\n    map(balance => balance.toFormat(2)), // Format the number nicely\n    map(balance => `${balance} ETH`) // Append 'ETH'\n  )\n  .subscribe(balance => console.log('balance', balance));\n\n// Logs:\n// balance 2,000.00 ETH\n// ...\n\nSee https://codesandbox.io/s/xp87z0xjmo.\nOnly log pair block numbers\nimport { map, filter } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nblockNumber$()\n  .pipe(\n    map(v => +v), // Convert BigNumber to number\n    filter(blockNumber => blockNumber % 2 === 0) // Filter out pair numbers\n  )\n  .subscribe(blockNumber => console.log('blockNumber', blockNumber)); // Same as before, log the result\n\n// Logs:\n// blockNumber 8548408\n// blockNumber 8548410\n// ...\n\nSee https://codesandbox.io/s/v37j38o38y.\nGet the balance of the current account\ndefaultAccount$()\n  .pipe(\n    switchMap(publicAddress => balanceOf$(publicAddress)),\n    withoutLoading(),\n    map(value => +value) // Return number instead of BigNumber\n  )\n  .subscribe(console.log);\n\n// Logs:\n// 2\n// ...\n\nConclusion\nRxJS has a lot of operators which you can use to combine the RpcObservables to build your app's logic. @parity/light.js provides the basic RpcObservables, and we let you combine them.\n"},"guides/tutorial4-send-a-transaction.html":{"url":"guides/tutorial4-send-a-transaction.html","title":"Tutorial Part 4: Send a Transaction","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial Part 4: Send a Transaction\nSo far we have only seen RpcObservables that read data from the blockchain, we have not yet had any impact on the blockchain's state - we have not yet sent a transaction.\nThe post$ RpcObservable\nArguments\nCreating a new transaction is a simple affair. The function post$ takes as first argument an object describing the transaction. There are several keys it may contain:\n\nto The recipient of the transaction; undefined or null indicates this is a contract-creation transaction.\nfrom The sender of the transaction; must be an account which the user controls. Will default to bonds.me.\nvalue The amount of ether to send to the recipient or endow any created contract.\ncondition A condition on which to predicate the distribution, but not the approval/signing, of the transaction. This is an object which contains one of two keys: block (which dictates the minimum block number before distribution) and time (the same but for block timestamp).\ngas The amount of gas to supply with the transaction. By default, it will attempt to estimate the amount of gas to supply. Such that the transaction succeeds without exception/error.\ngasPrice The price (in Wei) per unit of gas. Will default to something sensible (in Parity's case, this is the median of the distribution formed from the last several hundred transactions).\nnonce The sender nonce of the transaction. Will default to the latest known value.\n\nThe second (optional) argument describes options to pass to this function. It is an object with the following keys:\n\nestimate: Will estimate the amount of gas required for this transaction first.\n\nReturn Value\nThe value to which the RpcObservable evaluates reflects the ongoing status of the transaction as it moves through the process of getting finalised. It is always an object with a single key/value. It can be:\n\n{\"estimating\": true} The amount of gas required for this transaction to execute is being determined (only fired if estimate is set to true).\n{\"estimated\": value} The amount of gas required for this transaction to execute has been determined as value; the user is about to be asked (only fired if estimate is set to true).\n{\"requested\": id} The user has been asked for approval of the transaction; id is the (numeric) identity of the request.\n{\"signed\": hash} The user has approved the transaction and the transaction has been signed to form a final transaction hash of hash. It is now ready to be sent to the network for inclusion in a new block.\n{\"confirmed\": receipt} The transaction has been confirmed into a block. The receipt of the transaction is provided as receipt, giving information concerning its operation, including any logs.\n{\"failed\": error} The transaction has failed. Generally this is because the user did not approve the transaction or otherwise signing could not take place. error is a string which contains any details regarding the situation.\n\nExample\nimport { post$ } from '@parity/light.js';\n\npost$({\n  to: '0x180fbce524fd79b4af8dccf83809acd9bc95fd1a',\n  value: 100 * 1e15 // value in wei\n}).subscribe(console.log);\n\n// Logs:\n// { requested: '0x1' }\n// { signed: '0x123...ff' }\n// { confirmed: {/* receipt object */} }\n\n"},"guides/tutorial5-work-with-contracts.html":{"url":"guides/tutorial5-work-with-contracts.html","title":"Tutorial Part 5: Work with Contracts","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial Part 5: Work with Contracts\nContract API basically comes in three pieces:\n\nthere is inspection of the contract state through calling constant functions.\nthere's state-changing transactions like transferring tokens to a counter-party.\nthere's event reception and reporting that (usually) happen when such a state change occurs\n\nAs of version v1.0.4 of @parity/light.js, the library only supports the two first functionalities. Let's see how they work. But before that, let's create a contract object.\nOur first contract\nLet's deal with the ERC20 contract, which is quite possible the most famous contract. We'll use the GavCoin contract, a test ERC20 contract deployed on Kovan at the address 0x4733659a5cB7896A65c918Add6f59C5148FB5ffa.\nThe ABI of a classic ERC20 can be found in a lot of places, for example within the @parity/contracts npm module.\nSo let's instantiate a contract object:\nimport erc20Abi from '@parity/contracts/lib/abi/eip20';\nimport { makeContract } from '@parity/light.js';\n\nconst gavcoinContract = makeContract(\n  '0x4733659a5cB7896A65c918Add6f59C5148FB5ffa',\n  erc20Abi\n);\n\nAnd done! gavcoinContract is now a javascript object, where all the keys are the functions in the contract with a $ sign at the end:\n{\n  abi: {...}, // @parity/abi Abi object, only needed for advanced usage\n  address: '0x4733659a5cB7896A65c918Add6f59C5148FB5ffa',\n  allowance$(): ...,\n  approve$(): ...,\n  balanceOf$(): ...,\n  contractObject: {...}, // @parity/api Contract object, only needed for advanced usage\n  totalSupply$(): ...,\n  transfer$(): ...,\n  transferFrom$(): ...\n}\n\nThe functions defined in the ABI are defined in this object too. We won't go into details about the abi and contractObject fields, but have a look at @parity/abi and @parity/api respectively if interested.\nCalling constant functions\nIn the ERC20 ABI, the balanceOf function is a constant function, which means that it doesn't modify the Ethereum state.

Concretely, this means:\n\nlow on resources usage: CPU, memory, storage, I/O operations...\nembeddable: in a desktop application, on mobile, within a web app\nbut still remains trustless\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Node\nLight Node\n\n\n\n\nSync time\n~days\n~seconds\n\n\nState size\n~gigs\n0\n\n\nDB size\n~tens of gigs\n~megs\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Parity's Light Client, please refer to our wiki: https://wiki.parity.io/Light-Client.\nCurrent Dapp Development Patterns\nIf you are a dapp developer, you are probably used to work with a remote full node on the backend, which you connect to with web3.js:\n\neither via MetaMask: web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);, which internally connects to INFURA.\nor connecting to INFURA directly: web3js = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io'));.\n\nSo all your JSONRPC requests require a network call. As such, some patterns for making these requests start to appear. Let's explore some of them, the use case is we want to constantly show the latest balance of an ERC20 token.\n1. Example of naive polling, which doesn't work well\nFor example, if you want to fetch the latest ERC20 token balance, the following piece of code (which might actually work), doesn't make sense:\nconst contract = web3.eth.Contract(ABI, '0x00..ff');\n\nsetInterval(async () => {\n  const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf('0x00..ff').call();\n\n  document.querySelector('#balance').textContent = balance;\n}, 500);\n\nWe're querying the contract balance every 500ms, so we're making a network request every 500ms. This is too many requests, and moreover, if one network requests takes more than 500ms to resolve, then the displayed result on your dapp could be outdated.\n2. Smart Polling\nThere are of course smarter patterns that we see coming again and again in the dapp development community, which become some basic 101 knowledge between dapp developers.\nconst contract = web3.eth.Contract(ABI, '0x00..ff');\n\nasync function updateBalance() {\n  const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf('0x00..ff').call();\n  document.querySelector('#balance').textContent = balance;\n}\n\nconst targetTime = 15 * 1000;\nsetTimeout(function update() {\n  const next = Date.now() + targetTime;\n  updateBalance().then(() => {\n    setTimeout(update, next - Date.now());\n  });\n});\n\n3. Pubsub\nA more intelligent way would be to have a \"push\" mechanism instead of a \"pull\" mechanism. With pubsub, we can subscribe to changes on the network. Here, we subscribing to new headers, and updating balance each time we receive a new header.\nconst contract = web3.eth.Contract(ABI, '0x00..ff');\n\nasync function updateBalance() {\n  const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf('0x00..ff').call();\n  document.querySelector('#balance').textContent = balance;\n}\n\nweb3.eth.subscribe('newBlockHeaders').on('data', updateBalance);\n\n@parity/light.js: Putting best patterns into a library\nWhich backend? Remote Full Node vs Light Client\nHere's a comparison of the advantages each type of node offers.\n\n\n\nRemote Full Node\nLight Client\n\n\n\n\n-\nWe don't use a centralized backend to fetch data we need.\n\n\n-\nWe verify the data we receive, instead of blindy trusting the backend.\n\n\nMuch easier to get started with.\n-\n\n\nLight Client still experimental today.\n-\n\n\n\nHowever, from the code's perspective, or from your dapp's UX perspective, both solutions are actually quite similar.\nRecall that:\n\nthe Light Client has no pending blocks or pending transactions.\nit actually doesn't have the state at all, so cannot verify and propagate incoming transactions.\nmo block bodies (so no transactions), so we cannot fetch transaction data fast.\n\nWhich means that all JSONRPC calls that require some state, transaction or block data, will require a network call. This is the same as a remote full node.\nThe (good) development patterns we explored above are therefore also relevant to Light Client development. And that's the goal of @parity/light.js.\nThe goal of @parity/light.js\nThe goal of @parity/light.js is basically to regroup all these patterns into a library, so that dapp developers don't need to think about patterns anymore, but just use a simple API provided by the library.\nInternally, @parity/light.js uses the Pubsub pattern described above, and mixes it up with Reactive Programming. Jump to the next chapter to find out more.\nLong-term vision\nOur long-term vision at Parity is to embed the Light Client a little bit everywhere: in a browser extension, in a mobile app, in a web app.\nIn order to do this, we plan to compile Parity to WASM, and embed it into a browser environment. This part is out of scope of this documentation, but if you are interested, please refer to this Github thread: https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/7915.\nFor example, if we embed it into a browser extension (Chrome Extension, Firefox Add-On), then the Light Client will continously run in your browser. Similarly to MetaMask, it will inject in authorized websites an Ethereum provider object, which will allow dapps to communicate with the Ethereum network via theextension's Light Client.\nIf we embed it into a web app directly, it should be as simple as:\n// myapp.js\nimport lightClient from '@parity/light-client';\n\nlightClient.run(/* Pass in optional flags like \"--chain ropsten\" etc.*/);\n\nWhich, behind the scenes, will spawn a Light Client in WASM, sync in a matter of seconds, and the web app will seamlessly become a light node on the network, ready to communicate with other peers.\nOther places where the Light Client belong are mobile applications or IoT devices.\n"},"concepts/reactive-programming.html":{"url":"concepts/reactive-programming.html","title":"Reactive Programming","keywords":"","body":"Reactive Programming\nIf you already know what Reactive Programming and Observables are, you can skip this section.\nWhat is Reactive Programming?\nReactive programming is a programming mindset where you deal with data streams. A data stream is simply a sequence of data (called events) ordered in time. Some simple examples of data streams include:\n\nclicks on a button\nmake an API call (this stream only fires one event, namely the API response)\ntweets in your Twitter feed\nnew blocks on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nReactive programming is the idea that you application is defined by a bunch of streams, and you combine those streams together to build the app's logic. For instance, making an API call on button click is managed by combining the first two streams described above: each time the button-click stream fires, we \"plug in\" the API-call stream.\nThe combination of streams is defined declaratively, which makes the code easy to read and test.\nObservables\nStreams are represented by Observables. They emit the data once, multiple times, or periodically based on their configuration. There are also various operators on Observables to transform or filter the data they emit.\nOn the other side, we have Observers. They consume the data emitted by Observables, by subscribing to them, and imperatively doing some operations on each received value, like printing the value to the console.\nIn a nutshell, you define you app's logic by declaratively combining Observables, and eventually, an Observer subscribes to the resulting Observable. This Observer prints the value or updated a React component.\nRxJS\nThere are numerous implementations of Observables, the one we are using is RxJS 6. It is, as of today, the most popular one in the JavaScript community.\nLearn more\nIf you wish to learn more about React programming, please read this excellent guide by Andre Staltz.\n"},"concepts/rpc-observables.html":{"url":"concepts/rpc-observables.html","title":"RpcObservables","keywords":"","body":"RpcObservables\nThe whole library @parity/light.js works with the concept of RpcObservables.\nThe name RpcObservable might actually not be the best, because it's actually not an Observable. A RpcObservable is a function returning an Observable.\nHere's the TypeScript type of a RpcObservable:\nexport interface RpcObservable {\n  (...args: any[]): Observable;\n  metadata?: Metadata;\n}\n\nOr in simple words: a RpcObservable is a function returning an Observable, and this function has some metadata.\nLet's have a look at MetaData:\nexport interface Metadata {\n  // --snip--\n  frequency?: FrequencyObservable[];\n  name?: string;\n  pipes?: (...args: any[]) => OperatorFunction[];\n}\n\nThese are the most important fields of MetaData, which we will explain.\nMain Idea\nWe believe that data streams are an intuitive way to express events happening on the Ethereum blockchain. The most obvious example is the pubsub pattern we described before, where we wanted to fetch the balance on every new block.\nIt's intuitive to have an Observable, called onEveryBlock$, that would fire an event each time it receives a new block from the network. Then, every time it fires, we declaratively make an JSONRPC call to eth_getBalance. Into code, it looks like this:\nimport { from } from 'rxjs';\nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n// Observable that makes a JSONRPC request\nconst fetchBalance = () => from(api.eth.getBalance('0x12..ff');\n\n// On every block, we make that JSONRPC request\nonEveryBlock$.pipe(switchMap(fetchBalance)));\n\nSimilarly, if we want to check our peer count every 5 seconds, we'd do\nimport { from } from 'rxjs';\nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n// Observable that makes a JSONRPC request\nconst checkPeerCount = () => from(api.net.peerCount();\n\n// On every block, we make that JSONRPC request\nonEvery5Seconds$.pipe(switchMap(checkPeerCount)));\n\nThe main idea of @parity/light.js is the following: \"on every [frequency], we do [something]\".\nOn every new block, we call eth_balance. On every 5 seconds, we call net_peerCount. Etc.\nLooking back at the MetaData above, the frequency field holds the frequency, which is an array of FrequencyObservables, and the pipes hold an array of RxJS pipe functions, and each of them does something.\nFrequencyObservable\nSome examples of FrequencyObservable shipped with @parity/light.js are:\n\nonEveryBlock$\nonEvery2Blocks$\nonEverySecond$\nonEvery5Seconds$\nonSyncingChanged$ (fires when sync status changes)\nonAccountsChanged$ (fires when you change account)\nonStartup$ (fires once at dapp start)\netc.\n\nThe full list can be seen in the API section.\nRpcObservable\nAn RpcObservable can either have a frequency, or depend on another RpcObservable which has a frequency.\nRpcObservable with frequencies\nAn RpcObservable with a frequency has its Metadata.frequency field filled with one or more FrequencyObservables. For example, balanceOf$ has as frequency of [onEveryBlock$].\nThen, this RpcObservable has an array of pipes, which will be piped to the FrequencyObservable. For example, balanceOf$ has one pipe which make a eth_getBalance JSONRPC request.\nRpcObservable which depends on another RpcObservable\nSome RpcObservable don't have their own frequencies, but depend on a parent RpcObservable. This is the case of defaultAccount$, which depends on account$. In this case, the Metadata.dependsOn field points to the parent RpcObservable.\nThese RpcObservables still have some pipes. For example defaultAccount$ has one pipe which takes the 1st element of the array returned by accounts$.\nCalling an RpcObservable\nAs per the TypeScript signature, the RpcObservable function can take arguments. These arguments are then passed down into the pipes. For instance, the argument 0x123 in balanceOf$('0x123') is passed down into balanceOf$'s pipes, i.e. into the JSONRPC eth_getBalance call.\nExamples of RpcObservable\n\naccounts$: Returns the array of accounts managed by the node. Frequency is onAccountsChanged$.\ndefaultAccount$: Returns the default active account. Depends on accounts$.\nblockNumber$: Returns the current block number. Frequency is onEveryBlock$.\npeerCount$: Returns the number of peers.
